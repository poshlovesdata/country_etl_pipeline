# **My First ETL Pipeline ðŸš€**

I'm excited to share my very first ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline! This project represents a significant milestone in my data engineering journey.

Below is a simple architecture of the pipeline:

---

## **Features**

- **Extract**: Fetches raw data from [RestCountries](https://restcountries.com/) API.
- **Transform**: Processes, cleans, and structures the data for analysis.
- **Load**: Stores the transformed data into a target database or file for easy access.

---

## **Technologies Used**

- **Python**: Core programming language for the pipeline logic.
- **Pandas**: For data transformation and manipulation.
- **Requests**: To fetch data from APIs.
- **SQLite**: (Optional) As the target database for storing transformed data.
- **Git**: Version control for project management.

## **How to Run the Pipeline**

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/poshlovesdata/country_etl_pipeline
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
3. Install the requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the pipeline script:
   ```bash
   python etl_.py
   ```

## **Project Goals**

- Learn and implement the ETL process from scratch.
- Gain hands-on experience with API integration, data cleaning, and database loading.
- Showcase my ability to build scalable data pipelines.

## **Future Improvements**

- Add error handling and logging for more robust execution.
- Incorporate data validation during the transformation phase.
- Schedule the pipeline using tools like Apache Airflow or Prefect.
